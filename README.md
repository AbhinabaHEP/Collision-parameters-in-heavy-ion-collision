# Collision-parameters-in-heavy-ion-collision
I have studied the correlation of  event level information like impact parameter and transverse spherocity using AMPT generated heavy ion collision data of Au + Au collisions at 7.7 GeV. 
We have studied 10,000 collision events out of 1,00,000 simulated events.
